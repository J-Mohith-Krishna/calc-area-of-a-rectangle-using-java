## Description-
    The "Rectangle Area Calculator" Java program takes user input for the length and width of a rectangle, calculates its area, and displays the result. It showcases basic user interaction and method usage for a straightforward mathematical computation.
## Explanation-
    1. We use the Scanner class to get input from the user.
    2. We prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle.
    3. The program then calculates the area of the rectangle using a separate method (calculateRectangleArea).
    4. The result is displayed to the user.
